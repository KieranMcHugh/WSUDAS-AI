For weekly filtering:

filter everything
step thru every week
should have 6-7 data points

grab the last value from that week range

data from Monday is null if we have data from Tuesday
should not updateOrInsert() for trap_counts

move forward a week, grab last record

get first date we have record entry for for that trap

if no data in that time period, skip it
