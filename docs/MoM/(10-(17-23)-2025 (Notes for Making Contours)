(may need to navigate to contours thru DAS dashboard for the moment)

https://potatoes.localhost/admin/potatoes/trap-counts-upload ---- upload data for traps (note: station names need to match those of saved ones)

generate contours:

php artisan contours:create --on_day=monday --model_id=1 ---- need to switch to the current day

when writing in PHPStorm: need to set version to 8.2 (or 8.1, whichever doesn't show errors on existing code)


switching to contour-dev (should be done now):

git checkout contour-dev

git stash (if necessary)

php artisan migrate

npm run dev
