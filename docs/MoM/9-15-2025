meeting stuff

almond people:
see contour maps for bug data

previously had 1 set of locations, entered once per year

trap data gotten every week automatically

data used to produce contours

colors produced by interpolation

expand DAS to have more monitoring that can isolate nodes (done)

data entry for the above is still manual, someone has to paste in csv weekly

automated traps in California, people don't want to enter data manually

sprint 1 main focus: hook up automated traps to automatically go through contour system (will appease the almond people)

scoutlab traps data is being pulled in, need to use the data

later on (future sprints?):
insect abundance data mapped out
is spray going down at the right time?
insecticides often kill the eggs, not the insect
want to be able to click on a pin and see abundance + timing
	- give dynamic recommendations based on timing + 	abundance
integrate timing piece with abundance piece

linkage between population dynamics and phenology(???)

want to model space and time models together

automated data
