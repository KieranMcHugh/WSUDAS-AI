https://das.localhost/admin/potatoes/trap-locations   <-------------------- shows map




want to track coddling moth for now, could hard code for now (will need to be flexible in the future)

-----------

To get coddling moth ID:

$cmId = Model::whereCode(‘CM’)->pluck(‘id’);

or something like:

$cm_model_id = Model::whereCode(‘CM’)->pluck(‘id’);

want model_id to be coddling moths in specific

-----------


generate contours:

php artisan contours:create --on_day=monday --model_id=1 ---- need to switch to the current day

when writing in PHPStorm: need to set version to 8.2 (or 8.1, whichever doesn't show errors on existing code)


switching to contour-dev (should be done now):

git checkout contour-dev

git stash (if necessary)

php artisan migrate

npm run dev
