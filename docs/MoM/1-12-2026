changes needed from last semester:

need to grab last active date for trap instead of arbitrary date

if there is not a record then use fallback date for 1 year



look at record on the contour table

if record does not exist, go back to start of the year

otherwise use sliding window of record as start date (i.e. go to next sunday 2026-01-04 -> 2026-01-11 (sample dates))

since it's updating every week pulling in 1 item at a time
