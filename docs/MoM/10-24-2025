every sunday pull data & generate new traps

only 2 endpoints that worked with scoutlabs was export device delta count and

php:artisan traps

entering data to:

service_models -> contour_locations

add scoutlabs data id

generate region id for scoutlabs

maybe make a command that creates a new contour region

artisan command ^

make a scheduled command that pulls data over

match contour_trap_counts

created_at record 

have 3 crops and pest associated with it

each crop needs contour map generated with them

inside of the location, lat and long are stored

need name, region id, and year

need command 

query SQL-like to get id

need contour trap counts

need 3 different model ids (Jesse might work on)

location id will map to a location

survey date will be from every sunday

trap_count is the detection count

scoutlabs_traps needs to go to contour_locations

have everythign we need except contour_region id (do not make a static variable, whatever the name is, the id should not be hard-coded, get from the name), need to make that manually

dd(ContourRegion::where('name', 'Scout Lab Traps')->pluck('id'));

in weather:


trap_count (model id w/ Jesse) location id needs to be associated with a trap in contour_location

trap_id to id in contour_trap_counts, which gets name and then gets id from contour_locations

have to bring over the scoutlab traps model and scotulabs trap record model will both need to be mirrored in device_models (because data flows from weather into models, models pulls data from weather)

process would be running weekly during production (sunday morning @ midnight, ours might run 7-8pm)

php artisan make:model ScoutLabDevice ( <- model we make)

copy over what we have on weather

pull ScoutLabTrap data to models

Generating Model Classes in Laravel documentation, otherwise standalone SQL queries

next steps:

have understanding of how to use models and how to navigate

can just grab data from connection (weather) and table (scoutlabs records)

see how you can pull data from weather database and models

read data from Laravel database ******** <- main goal

read over Laravel documentation

Jesse will write documentation
