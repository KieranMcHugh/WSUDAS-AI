10/6 meeting:

for 2nd semester: pulling in additional trap data when looking over stations

dto(?) service that sits over api

how stations work:

base station class

networks inherit from station class

awn: school's weather network (also have virtual station) - inherit from separate class, base class pulls data from class and creates separate data class
cant make changes to weather database without changing everything ("has magic behind it")

missing values are likely due to loading just station network or station by itself

getStationByID()

model data needed by web which is in a separate place

tries to map userID for map from model schema, not web schema

contours & models are where the bulk of the work are going to come from

look at contour dev branch, try and spin up some contour maps to get a better understanding of how the code works

have own contour map for potatoes

access potatoes.localhost

ca.localhost (for cannabis, probably not needed)
