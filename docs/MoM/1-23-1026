run all of the models at once

trim down to best models

push data thru the best models

choose the one giving most realistic data

use that model going forward



end goal: going to run weather data through this model

see what data we get back from coldheartiness



apply this to grapes being grown in BC, specifically using coldheartiness models

how hard would it be to push our data thru it and get data out?

ultimate end goal: being able to push live weather data from DAS stations to the model and look at the results
