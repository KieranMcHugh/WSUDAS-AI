trap data IS NOT pulled in weekly, it is pulled in daily (should not effect scheduling though)

use SMAPP_id to distinguish between duplicate locations in scout_labs_traps

can do connection and use weather connection: "DB::connection(‘weather’)->table(‘scout_lab_traps’)->where(…)"

app/Console/Commands/ContoursCreate.php

--------> instead of grabbing names for traps, want to instead grab smapp_id






pull region_id

grab locations in the contour map

see data from the locations






now we grab the latest record

if record from Saturday doesn't exist, grab data from previous days

log if trap data does not exist
